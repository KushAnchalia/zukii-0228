Use the correct VAPI widget script that creates a floating button:\n   - The widget script URL should be: https://cdn.vapi.ai/widget.js\n   - OR use the proper VAPI Web SDK initialization\n\n2. The HTML should include:\n   - The VAPI public key: 919bbeaa-d657-4c72-a7b9-8772ac8ebd19\n   - The assistant ID (vapi_agent_id from the API)\n   - Proper initialization that creates a visible floating button\n\n3. Try this approach for the widget:\n   ```html\n   <script>\n     var vapiInstance = null;\n     (function(d, t) {\n       var g = d.createElement(t), s = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];\n       g.src = \"https://cdn.vapi.ai/widget.js\";\n       g.defer = true;\n       g.async = true;\n       s.parentNode.insertBefore(g, s);\n       g.onload = function() {\n         vapiInstance = window.vapiSDK.run({\n           apiKey: \"919bbeaa-d657-4c72-a7b9-8772ac8ebd19\",\n           assistant: \"ASSISTANT_ID_HERE\",\n           config: {\n             position: \"bottom-right\",\n             offset: \"40px\",\n             width: \"50px\",\n             height: \"50px\"\n           }\n         });\n       }\n     })(document, \"script\");\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n4. Or use the simpler embed approach:\n   ```html\n   <script\n     src=\"https://cdn.vapi.ai/widget.js\"\n     data-public-key=\"919bbeaa-d657-4c72-a7b9-8772ac8ebd19\"\n     data-assistant-id=\"ASSISTANT_ID_HERE\">\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n5. Make sure the popup window stays open and the widget actually renders as a floating button in the bottom-right corner that users can click to start voice chat.\n\nTest with the actual assistant ID from the API response.", "type": "bug", "passes": true, "id": 30}, {"description": "Fix the VAPI SDK loading error in the test popup. The error is 'Failed to load VAPI SDK'.\n\nThe issue is the CDN URL for the VAPI SDK is not correct. Try these fixes:\n\n1. Use the official VAPI widget script instead of the SDK:\n   ```html\n   <script src=\"https://cdn.vapi.ai/widget.js\"></script>\n   <script>\n     window.addEventListener('load', function() {\n       if (window.vapiSDK) {\n         window.vapiSDK.run({\n           apiKey: '919bbeaa-d657-4c72-a7b9-8772ac8ebd19',\n           assistant: 'ASSISTANT_ID',\n           config: { position: 'bottom-right' }\n         });\n       }\n     });\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n2. Or try unpkg CDN:\n   - https://unpkg.com/@vapi-ai/web@latest/dist/vapi.umd.js\n\n3. Or try skypack:\n   - https://cdn.skypack.dev/@vapi-ai/web\n\n4. Simplest approach - just use the embed script tag method:\n   ```html\n   <script \n     defer \n     src=\"https://cdn.vapi.ai/widget.js\"\n     data-public-key=\"919bbeaa-d657-4c72-a7b9-8772ac8ebd19\"\n     data-assistant=\"ASSISTANT_ID\">\n   </script>\n   ```\n   This should auto-create the widget button without any custom JavaScript.\n\n5. Make sure the script loads and creates the floating button automatically.\n\nTest multiple CDN URLs and use whichever one works.
